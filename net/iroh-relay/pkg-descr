Iroh's relay is a feature within iroh, a peer-to-peer networking system
designed to facilitate direct, encrypted connections between devices.
Iroh aims to simplify decentralized communication by automatically
handling connections through "relays" when direct connections aren't
immediately possible. The relay server helps establish connections by
temporarily routing encrypted traffic until a direct, P2P connection is
feasible. Once this direct path is set up, the relay server steps back,
and the data flows directly between devices. This approach allows Iroh
to maintain a secure, low-latency connection, even in challenging
network situations.
